# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their ratings and preferences. The recommendation system combines both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

## Dataset

We use the "small" MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,000 user ratings. The dataset includes information about movies, user ratings, user demographics, and tags, making it suitable for building a comprehensive recommendation system.

## Business Problem

The primary business problem addressed by this recommendation system is to enhance user engagement and satisfaction on a movie streaming platform. The objectives include increasing user retention, movie consumption, and overall user experience.

## User Interaction

To collect user ratings and preferences, the system implements an interactive rating system on the platform. Users are prompted to rate a set of movies upon logging in, and continuous feedback is gathered after each movie watched.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data collection includes user ratings, user demographics, and movie attributes. The data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality.

## Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation system employs a hybrid approach, combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. Content-based filtering utilizes movie attributes, while collaborative filtering identifies users with similar preferences.

## Evaluation

The system's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Precision-Recall. These metrics measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations.

## User Experience

Features implemented to enhance user experience include real-time recommendations, a personalized homepage, recommendations for similar users, diversity in recommendations, and explanations for why a movie is recommended.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore the movie recommendation system, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
