# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota. The goal is to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history. Recommendation systems are widely used in the entertainment industry to enhance user experience and engagement.

## Dataset

We used the "small" MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,000 user ratings, movie information, and user demographics. The dataset provides valuable insights for building a recommendation system.

## Business Problem

The primary business problem is to improve user engagement and satisfaction on a movie streaming platform. By providing personalized movie recommendations, we aim to increase user retention and movie consumption. To achieve this, we implemented an interactive rating system where users can rate movies and continuously provide feedback.

## User Interaction

- **Initial Ratings:** When a user logs in or creates an account, they are prompted to rate a set of movies. The initial set of movies is randomly selected from a pool of popular and diverse films in the dataset to understand the user's preferences.

- **Continuous Feedback:** Users are encouraged to rate movies after watching them, using a scale of 1 to 5 stars or a thumbs-up/thumbs-down rating. These ratings, along with the user's viewing history, are used to refine recommendations.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **User Ratings:** User ratings are collected and stored in the database, associating each rating with a user ID and a movie ID.

2. **Movie Data:** Movie attributes, including genre, release year, and director, are used to enrich the recommendation algorithm.

## Recommendation Algorithm

We implemented a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering:

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifies users with similar preferences and recommends movies that those users enjoyed.

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on their attributes and characteristics, such as genre and content similarity to previously rated movies.

## Evaluation

We used various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Precision-Recall, to evaluate the performance of our recommendation system. These metrics help assess how well our system predicts user preferences and provides relevant recommendations.

## User Experience

To enhance the user experience, we implemented several features:

1. **Real-time Recommendations:** Movies are recommended as soon as a user logs in or finishes watching a movie.

2. **Personalized Homepage:** A curated list of movie recommendations based on the user's preferences.

3. **Recommendations for Similar Users:** Highlighting movies liked by users with similar tastes.

4. **Diversity in Recommendations:** Ensuring that recommendations include a variety of genres and styles.

5. **Explanation of Recommendations:** Providing reasons for why a movie is recommended (e.g., "Recommended because you liked [Movie Name]").

## Conclusion

Building an effective movie recommendation system can significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction on a streaming platform. By continuously collecting user ratings and utilizing collaborative and content-based filtering, we aim to provide top movie recommendations tailored to each user's unique preferences, thereby enhancing their overall experience.
